# FeedFirst - An Intelligent Food Bank System

## The Problem

In many communities, access to food assistance can be inconsistent and difficult to navigate. Individuals in need often struggle to find local food pantries, manage limited resources, and navigate a cumbersome process to request aid. On the other side, food pantry managers face challenges in maintaining accurate inventory, tracking food voucher requests, and coordinating with volunteers. The lack of streamlined communication and real-time data between recipients and pantry managers can result in inefficiencies, stock shortages, and missed opportunities for people to get the help they need.

FeedFirst addresses these challenges by creating a centralized system that simplifies the process for both recipients and pantry managers, ensuring that no one in need is left without access to food.
